        Since November, abortion facilities in South Texas, Beaumont, and the Panhandle have closed as a result of strict abortion regulations approved in July by the Republican-led Texas legislature. In August, before the rules took effect, there were 40 abortion providers in Texas; now, there are 28, according to the Department of State Health Services. When additional rules take effect in September requiring abortion clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers, the number of abortion facilities will drop to six. 
        </p><p>
        While the state says the additional regulations are necessary to protect women's safety, abortion providers have challenged their constitutionality, arguing the regulations create an undue burden on women's access to a legal medical procedure.
        </p><p> 
        Use the map below to see how the number of abortion facilities in Texas has changed as a result of the new regulations. Abortion clinics are marked in teal, and ambulatory surgical centers that perform aboriton are marked in yellow.
